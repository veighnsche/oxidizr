# Download Analytics Summary

_Distro: manjaro_

This summary was generated by the in-container runner by parsing tool output.
Numbers are approximate but useful to flag excessive downloads.

## Totals
- Pacman packages downloaded: 31
  - Examples:
    - gcc-15.2.1+r22+gc4e96a094636-1-x86_64 (x1)
    - diffutils-3.12-2-x86_64 (x1)
    - xxhash-0.8.3-1-x86_64 (x1)
    - jansson-2.14.1-1-x86_64 (x1)
    - pkgconf-2.5.1-1-x86_64 (x1)
- Rustup components downloaded: 0 (approx bytes: 0)
- Cargo crates downloaded: 0 (approx bytes: 0)
- Git clones: 1 (approx bytes: 0)
- makepkg downloads: 0

## Heuristic Minimum (ideal warm run)
On a warm run with persistent caches and prebuilt image:
- Pacman: 0 new package downloads (if base deps baked or pacman cache mounted).
- Rustup: 0 components (toolchain cached under /root/.rustup).
- Cargo: 0 crates (registry/git cached; incremental build).
- Git/makepkg: 0 (AUR helper cached under /home/builder/build).

## Suggestions
- Ensure persistent mounts are active: /root/.rustup, /root/.cargo/(registry|git), /workspace/target, /var/cache/pacman, /home/builder/build.
- Pre-bake more base dependencies if first-run downloads are too heavy.
- Consider cargo sparse registry and lockfile pinning to reduce updates.
- If pacman updates occur frequently, pin mirror and reduce Syyu frequency.
